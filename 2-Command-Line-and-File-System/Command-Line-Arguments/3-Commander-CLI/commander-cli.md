# Commander CLI:
---

### 📦 Step 1: Import `commander`

```js
const { Command } = require('commander');
const program = new Command();
```

* `commander` is a library for building command-line interfaces (CLIs).
* `Command` is the main class — you're creating an instance called `program` to define all your commands (`add`, `list`, `remove`, etc).

---

### 🧠 Step 2: Program Info

```js
program
  .name('notes')                          // CLI tool name
  .description('A simple CLI notes app') // Shows up in help
  .version('1.0.0');                      // Version shown in help or via --version
```

This sets up metadata for your CLI. If you run:

```bash
node notes.js --help
```

You’ll see this info printed.

---

### 🛠 Step 3: Define `add` Command

```js
program
  .command('add')                            // notes add
  .description('Add a new note')            // Help text
  .argument('<title>', 'Note title')        // Required positional argument
  .argument('<body>', 'Note body')          // Required positional argument
  .action((title, body) => {                // Function that runs when this command is used
    console.log(`Adding note: ${title}`);
    console.log(`Content: ${body}`);
    // you'd save the note here
  });
```

This lets the user run:

```bash
node notes.js add "Shopping" "Buy eggs and milk"
```

* `add` is the command
* `"Shopping"` is the title
* `"Buy eggs and milk"` is the body

---

### 📄 Step 4: Define `list` Command

```js
program
  .command('list')
  .description('List all notes')
  .action(() => {
    console.log('Listing all notes...');
    // you'd read and show saved notes here
  });
```

The `list` command takes no arguments. Example:

```bash
node notes.js list
```

---

### ❌ Step 5: Define `remove` Command

```js
program
  .command('remove')
  .description('Remove a note by title')
  .argument('<title>', 'Note title to remove')
  .action((title) => {
    console.log(`Removing note: ${title}`);
    // you'd delete that note from storage
  });
```

This lets the user remove a note by title:

```bash
node notes.js remove "Shopping"
```

---

### 🚀 Final Line: Parse the Input

```js
program.parse();
```

This tells `commander` to look at `process.argv` and run the correct command based on what the user typed.

---

### ✅ Summary: What Does This App Do?

You’ve defined a command-line app called `notes` with these commands:

| Command                    | What it does            |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `notes add <title> <body>` | Adds a new note         |
| `notes list`               | Lists all saved notes   |
| `notes remove <title>`     | Removes a note by title |

Right now, it only logs text to the console — but you can later:

* Store notes in a file (with `fs`)
* Use `chalk` to color text
* Use `inquirer` for fancy prompts (optional)

# Understanding Syntax:

## 📌 Part 1: `.argument('<title>', 'Note title')`

### ✅ What it does:

This **defines a required positional argument** for your CLI command.

### 🔍 Syntax:

```js
.argument('<name>', 'description')
```

| Syntax    | Meaning                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| `<title>` | Required argument named `title` |
| `[title]` | Optional argument named `title` |

So this:

```js
.argument('<title>', 'Note title')
```

Means:

> "This command requires a **title** argument, and its help description is 'Note title'."

---

### 💡 Example in context:

```js
program
  .command('remove')
  .description('Remove a note by title')
  .argument('<title>', 'Note title to remove')
  .action((title) => {
    console.log(`Removing note: ${title}`);
  });
```

If you run:

```bash
node notes.js remove Shopping
```

* `"Shopping"` will be passed into `action()` as the `title` parameter.
* If you forget to pass `title`, it will show an error, because it's required (`<title>`).

---

## 📌 Part 2: `.action((title, body) => { ... })`

### ✅ What it does:

`.action()` is a function that **runs when the user executes this command**.
It receives all arguments (positional and options) in order.

### 🔍 Syntax:

```js
.action((arg1, arg2, ..., options) => {
  // logic here
})
```

* The parameters match the order of `.argument()` calls.
* For commands with options (like flags `--sort`), a final `options` object is also passed.

---

### 💡 Example in context:

```js
program
  .command('add')
  .description('Add a new note')
  .argument('<title>', 'Note title')
  .argument('<body>', 'Note body')
  .action((title, body) => {
    console.log(`Adding note: ${title}`);
    console.log(`Content: ${body}`);
  });
```

If you run:

```bash
node notes.js add "Todo" "Finish homework"
```

* `"Todo"` goes into `title`
* `"Finish homework"` goes into `body`
* So `action()` is called like this:

  ```js
  action("Todo", "Finish homework")
  ```

**Output:**

```
Adding note: Todo
Content: Finish homework
```

---

### 🧠 Think of it like this:

You’re saying:

> When the user types `notes add <title> <body>`, run a function where:
>
> * First argument = `<title>`
> * Second argument = `<body>`
> * Do something with them inside `.action()`

---

### 🧪 Bonus: Optional arguments

If you change `.argument('<title>')` to `.argument('[title]')`, then the argument becomes optional. But for a notes app, you usually want `title` and `body` to be **required**, so stick to angle brackets `< >`.

---

### ✅ Final Recap:

| Code                     | Purpose                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `.argument('<title>')`   | Declares a **required argument**          |
| `.action((title) => {})` | Defines what the command **does** with it |


---

# 🔹 What does `program.parse()` do?

**`program.parse()`** is the method that tells Commander to:

> ✅ Read and process the command-line arguments (`process.argv`)
> ✅ Match them to your defined commands and options
> ✅ Run the correct `.action()` function with the parsed options

---

## 🔧 Syntax:

```js
program.parse(process.argv);
```

* `process.argv` is Node.js’s built-in array of CLI arguments.
* You can also call `program.parse()` without arguments — Commander will use `process.argv` by default in recent versions.

---

## 📌 Why is it at the end?

Because all your commands and options need to be **registered first**, before Commander can parse them.

### 🔁 Here's the flow:

1. Define your commands → `program.command(...)`
2. Define options → `.requiredOption(...)`
3. Attach action handlers → `.action(...)`
4. **Then call** `program.parse()` to actually execute based on CLI input

---

## 🧪 Example:

### Code:

```js
const { Command } = require('commander');
const program = new Command();

program
  .command('sayhi')
  .description('Say hello')
  .action(() => {
    console.log('Hello!');
  });

program.parse(process.argv); // 👈 This activates the CLI
```

### CLI Usage:

```bash
node app.js sayhi
```

✅ Output:

```
Hello!
```

Without `.parse()`, **nothing would happen** — your CLI app wouldn’t know what to do.

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

| `program.parse()` does...           | Why it matters                   |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Reads CLI input from `process.argv` | Enables your app to respond      |
| Finds matching commands/options     | Runs correct `.action()`         |
| Needed at the **end**               | After all commands/options setup |
