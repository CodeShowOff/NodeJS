Here's your complete code with simple comments and full explanation of how to use the `debugger` keyword and inspect a Node.js app in Chrome:

```js
// add a debugger keyword to pause execution at that line
debugger;

// rest of your code
const fs = require('fs');

fs.appendFile('log.txt', 'This is a test line\n', (err) => {
    if (err) {
        console.log('Error writing to file');
    } else {
        console.log('Successfully wrote to file');
    }
});
```

### How to Use the Debugger:

1. **Run with debugger enabled**
   Use this command in the terminal (replace `appendFile.js` with your filename):

   ```bash
   node inspect appendFile.js
   ```

2. **Youâ€™ll see a message like this:**

   ```
   Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/xxxxxxxxxxx
   For help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector
   ```

3. **Open Chrome and go to:**

   ```
   chrome://inspect
   ```

4. **Steps in Chrome:**

   * Under **Remote Target**, you will see your Node.js script listed.
   * Click **Inspect**.
   * The Chrome DevTools debugger will open.
   * You can now:

     * Step through code
     * View variable values
     * Set breakpoints
     * Use the console

Let me know if you want a version with breakpoints or file reading examples too.
