Absolutely! I’ll walk you through **step-by-step** how to debug your Node.js code using **VS Code** — even if you're brand new.

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step: Debug Node.js in VS Code

---

### 🧱 1. **Make sure you have this:**

* VS Code installed ✅
* Node.js installed ✅
* A `.js` file (e.g. `app.js`) ✅
* VS Code **opened in the folder** where your file is saved ✅

---

### 📄 2. Sample `app.js` code to debug:

```js
// app.js
const name = process.argv[2] || "Guest";

function greet(user) {
    const message = `Hello, ${user}!`;
    return message;
}

const result = greet(name);
console.log(result);
```

---

### 🧭 3. Open VS Code and do this:

1. Open your `app.js` file.
2. On the left sidebar, click on the **Run and Debug icon** (▶️ with a bug).
3. Click **"Run and Debug"** → Then choose **"Node.js"** (or "Create a launch.json" if prompted).

---

### ⚙️ 4. VS Code will auto-create a `.vscode/launch.json`

If it doesn't, you can make one manually:

#### 📁 Create a file: `.vscode/launch.json`

Paste this inside:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Debug app.js",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js",
      "args": ["Shubham"]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 🛑 5. Set a Breakpoint

* In `app.js`, click in the **left margin** next to a line (e.g., on `return message;`) — a **red dot** will appear. This is your **breakpoint**.

---

### ▶️ 6. Start Debugging

* In the **Run and Debug panel**, click the green **▶️ "Start Debugging"** button.
* Your app will start, and **pause at the breakpoint**.

---

### 🔍 7. Explore the Debugger

* **Hover over variables** to see values.
* Check **“Variables”, “Call Stack”, “Watch”, “Breakpoints”** in the left panel.
* Use the buttons on top:

  * ▶️ Continue
  * ⏭ Step Over
  * ⏬ Step Into
  * ⏹ Stop

---

### 💡 Optional: Use the Debug Console

* Use `console.log()` or the **Debug Console tab** to try things live.

---

### ✅ That’s it!

Now you’re debugging like a pro — no `inspect`, no Chrome tabs, all inside VS Code.

---

Let me know if:

* You want to debug async code (like reading files)
* You want to use `require`-based or ES Module syntax
* You’re using TypeScript or want breakpoints in multiple files

I’ll guide you through!
