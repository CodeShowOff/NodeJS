Great question!

### 🟢 `response.ok` in `fetch`

In the `fetch()` API, `response.ok` is a **Boolean** that tells you whether the HTTP response was successful — meaning **status code is in the range 200–299**.

---

### ✅ Example:

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.ok); // true if status is 2xx
    console.log(response.status); // e.g., 200, 404, etc.
  });
```

---

### ℹ️ Behind the scenes:

* `response.ok === true` → status code is **200–299** (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created)
* `response.ok === false` → status is **not** in that range (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error)

---

### 🔴 Why check `response.ok`?

Because `fetch()` **doesn't throw an error** for HTTP errors by default. For example:

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/404')  // returns 404
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.ok); // false
    return response.json(); // still tries to parse, could throw!
  });
```

So you typically write:

```js
if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}`);
}
```

To safely handle errors and avoid trying to parse a bad response.
