## 📘 Let's Understand JSON

### ❓ What is JSON?

* **JSON** stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**.
* It's a **lightweight data format** used for storing and exchanging data.
* It looks like a JavaScript object, but it's just a **string** when stored or transmitted.
* Widely used in APIs, configuration files, databases, etc.


## 🔐 Important Notes:

* `JSON.stringify()` converts objects to JSON **strings**.
* `JSON.parse()` converts JSON **strings** back to objects.
* JSON supports:

  * Strings
  * Numbers
  * Booleans
  * Arrays
  * Objects
  * `null`
* JSON does **not support**:

  * Functions
  * `undefined`
  * Symbols
