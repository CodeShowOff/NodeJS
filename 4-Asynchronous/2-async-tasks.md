Great question! If JavaScript is **single-threaded**, then **how does it handle asynchronous tasks like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, or `Promise`?**

The answer lies in the **JavaScript runtime environment**, which consists of **more than just the single-threaded engine**. Let’s explain this clearly.

---

## 🧠 Key Concept: JavaScript is single-threaded, but the environment is not.

The **JavaScript engine** (like V8 in Chrome or Node.js) runs one line at a time — that's the **single-threaded** part.
But it's hosted in an **environment** (browser or Node.js) that provides:

* **Web APIs** (like `setTimeout`, `fetch`)
* **Callback queue / task queue**
* **Event loop**

These components **work together** to allow async behavior.

## ⚙️ How Asynchronous Tasks Work (Step-by-step)

Let’s walk through an example:

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout callback");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
```

### What happens:

1. `console.log("Start")` runs — synchronous, prints "Start".
2. `setTimeout(...)` is called:

   * The **Web API** handles the timer.
   * JavaScript **does not wait**.
   * It sets the callback aside to run **later**.
3. `console.log("End")` runs.
4. When the timer expires (even if 0 ms), the **callback** is added to the **task queue**.
5. The **event loop** checks: Is the call stack empty?

   * If yes, it moves the callback into the stack to run.
6. `"Timeout callback"` gets printed.

### Output:

```
Start
End
Timeout callback
```

## 🧩 Visualization of Components

* **Call Stack**: Executes synchronous code.
* **Web APIs**: Handle async operations outside JS thread (like timers, HTTP requests).
* **Task Queue / Callback Queue**: Stores async callbacks ready to run.
* **Event Loop**: Watches the stack. When it’s empty, moves tasks from the queue into the stack.

```
setTimeout ---> Web API timer ---> callback to task queue ---> Event loop ---> Call Stack
```

## ✅ Other Async APIs

| Async API                   | Who handles it?                                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `setTimeout`, `setInterval` | Browser/Node timer APIs                              |
| `fetch`, AJAX               | Browser’s networking stack                           |
| `Promise`                   | Microtask queue, runs after current synchronous code |
| `process.nextTick` (Node)   | Microtask (like Promise)                             |

---

## 🧠 Summary

* JavaScript runs **one thing at a time** (single-threaded).
* **Async tasks run outside** the main thread via **Web APIs** or **Node APIs**.
* The **event loop** orchestrates when to bring async code back in to be executed.
