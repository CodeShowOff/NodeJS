Great question ‚Äî this touches the core of why **asynchronous programming** exists in the first place.

You're asking:

> If we have to wait using `await`, then what's the point of making it async?

### üîÅ Short answer:

Because **async/await lets you wait *without blocking the rest of the program*** ‚Äî only the **current function pauses**, not everything else.

---

### üí° Real-world analogy:

Imagine you're at a restaurant:

* You **order food** ‚Üí it takes time to cook.
* Instead of standing at the kitchen window doing nothing (blocking), you **go sit down and talk to friends** or **check your phone**.
* When the food is ready, the waiter **notifies** you ‚Äî you get back to eating (resume).

That's what `await` in an `async` function does:

> "I‚Äôll pause **myself** here and wait for this to finish, but the **rest of the program can keep going**."

### üß† In programming terms:

#### ‚ùå Synchronous (blocking):

```js
function getData() {
  const response = fetch('https://api.example.com'); // Blocks everything!
  console.log('This will wait too.');
}
```

* Everything stops until `fetch()` is done. UI freezes.

#### ‚úÖ Asynchronous (non-blocking):

```js
async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com');
  console.log('This runs after response is received');
}

console.log('This runs immediately while we wait for fetch!');
```

* The `await` only pauses `getData()`, not the rest of the program.
* The app stays responsive. Other tasks (like animations, user interactions, etc.) continue.

---

### üîÑ Bonus: You don't always have to `await`

Sometimes, you fire off an async task but **don‚Äôt need to wait for it**:

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/data'); // fire-and-forget
console.log('Moving on without waiting');
```

---

### ‚úÖ Summary:

* `async/await` lets you **write readable code** that works like sync code, but **doesn‚Äôt block** the app.
* `await` pauses the **current function**, not the **whole program**.
* That's why it's useful **even when you ‚Äúwait‚Äù** ‚Äî it's a *non-blocking wait*.

Let me know if you want to explore how this works with the event loop or how to run multiple awaits in parallel!
