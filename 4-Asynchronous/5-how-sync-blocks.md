Great question again ‚Äî you're digging into the **core of synchronous vs asynchronous behavior in JavaScript runtimes** like **Node.js**.

Let‚Äôs answer this directly:

---

## ‚ùì Why Does `readFileSync` Block Everything?

```js
const fs = require('fs');

console.log("Start");
const data = fs.readFileSync('./bigfile.txt', 'utf8');
console.log("File read complete");
```

### üí° What's happening here?

* `fs.readFileSync` is a **synchronous I/O operation** provided by **Node.js**, not native JavaScript.
* When it's called, Node‚Äôs **JavaScript thread** sends a request to the operating system to read the file.
* Then ‚Äî and here's the key ‚Äî it **waits (blocks)** until the file read is completely finished.
* While it waits, the **event loop is paused**, and **nothing else in Node.js can happen** ‚Äî no `setTimeout`, no network, no other I/O, no rendering (if in Electron), nothing.

---

## üî¨ Internals: What‚Äôs Blocking?

### üß± JavaScript Thread

Node.js uses **libuv** under the hood for handling async I/O.

But when you use the **sync** variant (`readFileSync`), it **does not offload the task to the libuv thread pool**.

Instead:

* The **main thread makes a system call** and **waits** for the result (in a blocking way).
* No event loop iterations happen during that time.

So you‚Äôre blocking **the entire thread** ‚Äî which is where:

* Your code runs
* Timers fire
* Event listeners work

---

## ‚ùå Blocking Effects

If you do this in a production server (e.g. in an HTTP request handler), it can be **disastrous**:

```js
http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const data = fs.readFileSync('./file.txt'); // BLOCKS EVERY REQUEST
  res.end(data);
});
```

While reading the file:

* **All other incoming requests** are blocked.
* The server becomes unresponsive.

## ‚úÖ Why Doesn‚Äôt `await fs.promises.readFile()` Block?

Because it **uses a background thread pool** via `libuv`. The function returns a **Promise**, and:

1. The file read happens in the **background**.
2. The JS thread is **not blocked**.
3. When it's done, the event loop picks up the resolved value.

```js
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

console.log("Start");

const data = await readFile('./file.txt', 'utf8'); // Pauses only this async function

console.log("Read complete");
```

The app stays responsive, and **other async events keep flowing**.

## üîë Summary

| Operation                      | Blocking Behavior              | Thread Affected        | Notes                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `fs.readFileSync()`            | ‚úÖ Blocks entire Node.js thread | Main thread            | Halts all execution during read |
| `await fs.promises.readFile()` | ‚ùå Non-blocking                 | Uses libuv thread pool | Async, allows other tasks       |
