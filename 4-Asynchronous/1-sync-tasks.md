In JavaScript, **synchronous tasks block** because of the **single-threaded nature of the JavaScript runtime**, especially in environments like browsers and Node.js.

Letâ€™s break this down:

---

### âœ… **What is a synchronous task?**

A synchronous task is any code that is **executed immediately and sequentially**, line by line. Each line **must complete before the next line runs**.

---

### âœ… **Why do synchronous tasks block in JavaScript?**

JavaScript uses a **single-threaded event loop**, meaning:

* Only **one thing** can happen at a time.
* While a synchronous task is running, **no other code (including user interaction, rendering, or async callbacks)** can be executed.
* So, if a synchronous task is **long-running or CPU-intensive**, it **blocks the main thread**, causing delays or freezing the UI.

#### âž• Example:

```javascript
function blockForSeconds(seconds) {
  const end = Date.now() + seconds * 1000;
  while (Date.now() < end) {
    // Busy-wait loop (blocks everything)
  }
  console.log("Done blocking");
}

console.log("Start");
blockForSeconds(3);
console.log("End");
```

**Output:**

```
Start
Done blocking
End
```

During the `blockForSeconds(3)` execution:

* The browser **freezes**.
* No button clicks, rendering, or other scripts will run.
* Because it's **synchronous**, the event loop is blocked.

---

### âœ… **How does this blocking happen technically?**

1. **JavaScript runtime starts executing code from top to bottom.**
2. If it hits a **synchronous function**, it runs it **to completion** before moving on.
3. During this time, **no other tasks** (not even async callbacks) are processed.
4. Only after the stack is clear will the **event loop** handle new messages (e.g., `setTimeout`, `Promise.then`, UI events).

### ðŸ§  TL;DR

| Synchronous code | Description                       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Runs immediately | Blocks the main thread until done |
| Single-threaded  | Only one task at a time           |
| Long sync tasks  | Freeze UI, delay async execution  |
