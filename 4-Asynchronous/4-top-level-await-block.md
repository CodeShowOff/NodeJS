Excellent follow-up: **Does top-level `await` block?**

Short answer:
‚û°Ô∏è **Yes, it *does* block further top-level execution ‚Äî but only within the module it's used in.**
‚û°Ô∏è **No, it does *not* block the entire JS runtime or event loop.**

Let‚Äôs break it down.

---

## ‚úÖ What Is Top-Level `await`?

Normally, `await` is only allowed **inside an `async` function**.

But in **ES modules** (`.mjs` or using `type="module"`), you can use `await` **at the top level**, like:

```js
// main.mjs
const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
const data = await res.json();
console.log(data);
```

This is called **top-level await**, and it‚Äôs only available in **modules**, not in traditional scripts.

---

## ‚ùì Does It Block?

### ‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî It *pauses execution of the current module* until the `await` resolves.

So this **blocks other top-level statements in the same module** from running.

```js
// module.mjs
console.log("Before");
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
console.log("After"); // Runs after 2 seconds
```

‚û°Ô∏è `"After"` is blocked for 2 seconds.

---

### ‚ùå No ‚Äî It *doesn't block the entire JS runtime*.

Even though it *pauses the module*, it **does not block the event loop**, **UI rendering**, or **other async tasks**.

#### Example with two modules:

```js
// a.mjs
console.log("Module A start");
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));
console.log("Module A after await");

// b.mjs
console.log("Module B runs immediately");
```

If `a.mjs` imports `b.mjs`, and the import is structured properly (e.g. dynamic import or parallel modules), **module B can still execute while A is awaiting**.

So:

* ‚úÖ A‚Äôs execution is paused at `await`.
* ‚úÖ The rest of the environment is free to continue.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note for Node.js

In **Node.js**, top-level `await` is supported in:

* **ES modules** (`.mjs`)
* **REPL** (interactive console)
* **`--input-type=module`** in CLI

It does **not** work in CommonJS (`.js`) unless you wrap it in an `async` function.
